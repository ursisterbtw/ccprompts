# Contributing to ccprompts

This project is now a lightweight prompt library. There is no tooling or CI to fight—just well written Markdown.

## Workflow
1. Fork the repo and create a short-lived branch.
2. Add or edit prompt files under `commands/`, `agents/`, or `playbooks/`.
3. Keep changes focused and self-review for clarity and accuracy.
4. Open a pull request that explains why the prompt matters and how to try it.

## Writing Prompts
- Start with an H1 title and a one-line summary.
- Show the slash command syntax in a fenced code block.
- Break down intent, steps, and safety notes with clear headings.
- Prefer concise language over exhaustive checklists.

## Review Expectations
- There are no automated tests—proofread carefully.
- Confirm paths stay kebab-cased and files use UTF-8.
- If you remove material, mention the rationale in the PR body.

Thanks for helping keep ccprompts focused and approachable.
