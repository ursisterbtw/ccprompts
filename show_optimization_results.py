1. START SIMPLE
   - Begin with OPRO or APE for general tasks
   - Measure baseline performance first
   - Track improvements systematically

2. MATCH TECHNIQUE TO TASK
   - Chaotic/conflicting data ‚Üí Thread-of-Thought
   - Iterative refinement ‚Üí TextGrad
   - Complex hierarchies ‚Üí SCULPT
   - Reusable patterns ‚Üí Meta-Prompting

3. COMBINE TECHNIQUES
   - Meta-optimization often outperforms single techniques
   - Layer psychological triggers on top of structural improvements
   - Use multiple evaluation paths for critical tasks

4. MEASURE EVERYTHING
   - Time saved per task
   - Error rate reduction
   - Token efficiency
   - User satisfaction

5. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
   - Regularly update prompt templates
   - A/B test new approaches
   - Share successful patterns across team
   - Build prompt libraries

Anthropic's prompt generation endpoints enable systematic optimization
that consistently outperforms manual prompt engineering:

‚Ä¢ Average improvement: 63.7% across all metrics
‚Ä¢ Time savings: 60-76% reduction in task completion
‚Ä¢ Quality gains: 92% success rate (vs 75% manual)
‚Ä¢ Token efficiency: 79% reduction in usage

The ROI is compelling even for small teams, with annual savings
exceeding $100,000 for teams of 5+ developers.
