# Troubleshooting Examples

Examples for debugging and problem resolution

---

### Example 15: Production Debugging Session

**Scenario**: Complex production issue requiring systematic debugging

```bash
# Step 1: Initial problem assessment
/troubleshoot error production critical
/health-check production detailed

# Step 2: Comprehensive debugging
/debug-session production performance detailed
/analyze-project production-issues critical

# Step 3: Issue resolution and validation
/quick-fix production critical
/test production-fix comprehensive validation

# Step 4: Prevention and documentation
/monitor production enhanced alerting
/knowledge-base update production-issues troubleshooting
```

**Expected Outcome**:

- Systematic problem resolution minimizing downtime
- Root cause identification preventing recurrence
- Enhanced monitoring and team knowledge
- **Time Investment**: 2-6 hours debugging
- **Business Value**: Reduced downtime, prevention of similar issues

### Example 16: Development Environment Issues

**Scenario**: Team members experiencing inconsistent development environment issues

```bash
# Step 1: Environment standardization
/validate-environment team comprehensive
/export-config development-environment portable

# Step 2: Issue resolution and automation
/troubleshoot environment development medium
/bootstrap-project development-standardization automated

# Step 3: Documentation and knowledge sharing
/document environment-setup step-by-step
/knowledge-base create environment-troubleshooting searchable

# Step 4: Continuous improvement
/workflow-builder create environment-setup
/best-practices development-environment team consistency
```

**Expected Outcome**:

- Standardized development environment across team
- Automated setup reducing onboarding friction
- Comprehensive troubleshooting knowledge base
- **Time Investment**: 1-2 weeks standardization
- **Business Value**: Reduced development friction, faster onboarding
