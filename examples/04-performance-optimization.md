### Example 7: Database Performance Crisis

**Scenario**: Production database performance degrading under load

```bash
# Step 1: Immediate performance assessment
/analyze-project performance database,queries
/health-check production performance

# Step 2: Quick fixes for immediate relief
/quick-fix performance database

# Step 3: Comprehensive optimization
/optimize database queries aggressive
/optimize application caching strategic

# Step 4: Load testing and validation
/test performance comprehensive
/monitor database detailed real-time

# Step 5: Document improvements
/knowledge-base update performance-optimization database
```

**Expected Outcome**:

- Immediate performance improvements reducing user impact
- Long-term optimization preventing future issues
- Monitoring preventing performance regressions
- **Time Investment**: 4-8 hours immediate, 1-2 days comprehensive
- **Business Value**: Improved user experience, reduced infrastructure costs

### Example 8: Scalability Preparation

**Scenario**: Preparing application for 10x traffic increase

```bash
# Step 1: Current performance baseline
/analyze-project scalability performance,architecture
/test performance enterprise load-testing

# Step 2: Architecture modernization
/modernize monolith microservices gradual
/optimize infrastructure cloud-native

# Step 3: Monitoring and alerting
/monitor scalability proactive predictive
/setup-ci performance-testing automated

# Step 4: Deployment strategy
/deploy production canary safe
/backup production automated disaster-recovery
```

**Expected Outcome**:

- Scalable architecture handling 10x traffic
- Automated performance testing preventing regressions
- Robust monitoring and deployment processes
- **Time Investment**: 2-4 weeks
- **Business Value**: Support for business growth, reduced downtime risk
