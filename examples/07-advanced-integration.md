### Example 13: Multi-Environment CI/CD Pipeline

**Scenario**: Setting up sophisticated deployment pipeline with multiple environments

```bash
# Step 1: Environment setup and validation
/validate-environment production
/validate-environment staging
/validate-environment development

# Step 2: Comprehensive CI/CD setup
/setup-ci github enterprise multi-environment
/test integration comprehensive environments

# Step 3: Security and compliance integration
/harden ci-cd enterprise
/comply ci-cd soc2 automated

# Step 4: Monitoring and alerting
/monitor ci-cd comprehensive cross-environment
/incident-response ci-cd automated escalation
```

**Expected Outcome**:

- Robust CI/CD pipeline supporting multiple environments
- Automated security and compliance checking
- Comprehensive monitoring across deployment stages
- **Time Investment**: 1-2 weeks
- **Business Value**: Reliable deployments, faster time-to-market

### Example 14: Microservices Migration

**Scenario**: Migrating monolithic application to microservices architecture

```bash
# Step 1: Migration planning and assessment
/analyze-project microservices architecture,dependencies
/modernize monolith microservices strategic

# Step 2: Service extraction and testing
/refactor extract-service domain-driven safe
/test microservices comprehensive integration

# Step 3: Deployment and monitoring
/deploy microservices kubernetes blue-green
/monitor microservices distributed comprehensive

# Step 4: Team knowledge and processes
/knowledge-base create microservices-patterns team
/learn microservices-architecture advanced practical
```

**Expected Outcome**:

- Systematic migration minimizing business risk
- Comprehensive testing preventing service integration issues
- Team expertise in microservices patterns
- **Time Investment**: 3-6 months migration
- **Business Value**: Improved scalability, team autonomy, faster feature delivery
