### Example 3: Feature Development Lifecycle

**Scenario**: Developing a new payment processing feature with quality gates

```bash
# Step 1: Pre-development setup
/pre-commit strict
/learn payment-processing intermediate project

# Step 2: During development - continuous validation
/code-review feature security thorough
/test unit comprehensive

# Step 3: Pre-deployment validation
/audit-security payment-module critical
/validate-environment production

# Step 4: Deployment and monitoring
/deploy production blue-green safe
/monitor payment-service proactive real-time
```

**Expected Outcome**:

- Quality gates preventing security/performance issues
- Comprehensive test coverage for payment processing
- Safe production deployment with monitoring
- **Time Investment**: Ongoing throughout development
- **Business Value**: Reduced production issues, faster deployment

### Example 4: Code Quality Improvement Sprint

**Scenario**: Dedicated sprint to improve code quality and reduce technical debt

```bash
# Step 1: Assess current technical debt
/tech-debt analyze high codebase

# Step 2: Systematic refactoring
/refactor legacy-code modernize safe

# Step 3: Add comprehensive testing
/test integration comprehensive
/test mutation enterprise

# Step 4: Performance optimization
/optimize application queries aggressive

# Step 5: Document improvements
/release-notes v2.1.0 technical detailed
```

**Expected Outcome**:

- Quantified technical debt reduction
- Improved code maintainability and performance
- Comprehensive test coverage preventing regressions
- **Time Investment**: 1-2 week sprint
- **Business Value**: Increased development velocity, reduced bugs
