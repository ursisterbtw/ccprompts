### Example 11: Sprint Planning and Execution

**Scenario**: Planning and executing a complex feature sprint

```bash
# Step 1: Sprint planning
/sprint-planning plan medium 2-weeks
/tech-debt prioritize sprint-scope manageable

# Step 2: Daily coordination
/daily-standup prepare team slack
/workflow-builder create feature-development

# Step 3: Quality gates throughout sprint
/pre-commit strict team
/code-review continuous educational

# Step 4: Sprint completion
/release-notes v2.2.0 customer summary
/prompt-stats team sprint retrospective
```

**Expected Outcome**:

- Well-planned sprint with clear objectives
- Smooth daily coordination and communication
- High-quality deliverables with minimal rework
- **Time Investment**: Ongoing throughout sprint
- **Business Value**: Predictable delivery, higher quality

### Example 12: Remote Team Collaboration

**Scenario**: Coordinating complex project across distributed team

```bash
# Step 1: Establish collaboration patterns
/workflow-builder create remote-collaboration
/knowledge-base create team-processes searchable

# Step 2: Daily coordination automation
/daily-standup automate timezone-aware async
/export-config team-standards yaml

# Step 3: Quality assurance across team
/pre-commit team-standards automated
/code-review distributed-team educational

# Step 4: Knowledge sharing and documentation
/document team-handbook collaborative
/learn collaboration-tools advanced team
```

**Expected Outcome**:

- Effective coordination across time zones
- Consistent quality standards across team
- Shared knowledge base reducing dependencies
