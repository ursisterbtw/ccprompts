# MCP Command

This command provides access to MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configuration and testing prompts.

## Usage

```
/mcp [action] [integration]
```

## Description

Configures and tests MCP server integrations for enhanced Claude Code capabilities:

- Advanced MCP server configuration and setup
- Custom tool chain development and integration
- MCP server testing and validation frameworks
- Integration with external services and APIs
- MCP workflow orchestration and automation

## Parameters

- `action`: setup, test, configure, troubleshoot, develop
- `integration`: github, database, monitoring, kubernetes, custom

## Examples

```
/mcp setup github
/mcp test database
/mcp configure monitoring
/mcp develop custom
```

## Use Cases

- **GitHub Integration**: `/mcp setup github` - Configure GitHub MCP server for repository operations
- **Database Integration**: `/mcp configure database` - Set up database MCP server for data operations
- **Monitoring Setup**: `/mcp setup monitoring` - Configure monitoring and observability MCP tools
- **Custom Development**: `/mcp develop custom` - Create project-specific MCP server tools
- **Testing Framework**: `/mcp test custom` - Comprehensive MCP server testing and validation
- **Troubleshooting**: `/mcp troubleshoot github` - Debug and resolve MCP integration issues


## ðŸ”§ Advanced MCP Configuration & Testing (migrated from legacy MCP prompts)

- Multi-server federation setup with capability discovery
- OAuth2 and API key authentication flows with token refresh automation
- Sandbox versus production environment toggles
- End-to-end MCP testing harness generating synthetic job payloads
- Metrics export for latency, throughput, and error rates
