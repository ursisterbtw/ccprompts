## Phase 1: Problem Assessment & Triage

### Initial Information Gathering
1. **Analyze provided parameters**:
   - Issue type: {{issue-type}}
   - Context: {{context}}
   - Urgency: {{urgency}}

2. **Immediate Triage Actions**:
   ```bash
   # Check system status
   /health-check --quick
   
   # Verify recent changes
   git log --oneline -10
   git status
   
   # Check running processes
   ps aux | grep -E "(node|python|java|docker)"
   
   # System resources
   df -h
   free -h
   ```

3. **Collect Essential Information**:
   - Current error messages/symptoms
   - When the issue started
   - Recent changes or deployments
   - Affected systems/users
   - Reproduction steps

### Urgency-Based Response Protocol

**CRITICAL (Immediate Action Required)**:
- Production down, data loss risk, security breach
- Establish incident response team
- Implement immediate containment
- Begin detailed logging

**HIGH (Rapid Response)**:
- Significant user impact, service degradation
- Prioritize quick fixes and workarounds
- Implement monitoring and alerting

**MEDIUM/LOW (Systematic Approach)**:
- Focus on root cause analysis
- Emphasize learning and documentation
- Implement preventive measures

## Phase 2: Intelligent Error Analysis

### Error Pattern Recognition
Analyze error messages and symptoms using these patterns:

#### Common Error Categories
1. **Syntax/Logic Errors**:
   ```bash
   # Check recent code changes
   git diff HEAD~1 HEAD
   
   # Language-specific linting
   eslint . --fix
   pylint **/*.py
   rustc --version && cargo check
   ```

2. **Runtime Errors**:
   ```bash
   # Check logs
   tail -f /var/log/application.log
   journalctl -f -u service-name
   docker logs container-name --tail 100
   
   # Memory/resource issues
   htop
   iostat 1 5
   ```

3. **Network/Connectivity Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Network diagnostics
   ping google.com
   nslookup domain.com
   netstat -tulpn
   curl -v https://api.endpoint.com
   ```

4. **Database Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Database connectivity
   psql -h localhost -U user -d database -c "SELECT version();"
   mysql -u user -p -e "SHOW PROCESSLIST;"
   
   # Query performance
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM table;
   ```

5. **Environment Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Environment variables
   env | grep -E "(PATH|NODE|PYTHON|JAVA)"
   
   # Dependencies
   npm list --depth=0
   pip freeze
   composer show
   ```

### AI-Powered Analysis Workflow

1. **Symptom Analysis**:
   - Parse error messages for key indicators
   - Identify error patterns and common causes
   - Cross-reference with known issues database

2. **Context Correlation**:
   - Analyze recent changes in codebase
   - Check deployment and configuration changes
   - Review system and application logs

3. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Determine scope of affected systems
   - Assess user impact and business consequences
   - Prioritize resolution strategies

## Phase 3: Systematic Debugging Workflow

### Step-by-Step Debugging Process

#### 1. Reproduce the Issue
```bash
# Create isolated test environment
docker run -it --rm debugging-env
# Or use existing test environment
cd test-environment
npm run test:debug
```

#### 2. Isolate the Problem
- **Binary Search Approach**: Systematically eliminate possibilities
- **Minimal Reproduction**: Strip down to simplest failing case
- **Component Testing**: Test individual components in isolation

#### 3. Gather Evidence
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export DEBUG=*
export LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Collect system information
uname -a
cat /etc/os-release
docker version
kubectl version --client
```

#### 4. Hypothesis Formation
- List possible causes based on symptoms
- Rank hypotheses by likelihood and impact
- Design tests to validate/invalidate hypotheses

#### 5. Test Solutions
- Implement fixes in isolated environment
- Validate solutions against test cases
- Document changes and their effects

### Debugging Techniques by Issue Type

#### Error Debugging
```bash
# Stack trace analysis
grep -A 10 -B 5 "ERROR" /var/log/app.log

# Exception handling
python -c "import traceback; traceback.print_exc()"

# Core dumps (if applicable)
gdb application core.dump
```

#### Performance Debugging
```bash
# Application profiling
python -m cProfile -o profile.stats app.py
node --prof app.js
go tool pprof profile.pb.gz

# System monitoring
sar -u 1 60  # CPU usage
sar -r 1 60  # Memory usage
sar -d 1 60  # Disk I/O
```

#### Behavior Debugging
```bash
# State inspection
redis-cli monitor
tail -f /var/log/audit.log

# API testing
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/test
```

#### Environment Debugging
```bash
# Container debugging
docker exec -it container-name /bin/bash
kubectl describe pod pod-name
kubectl logs pod-name --previous

# Service debugging
systemctl status service-name
journalctl -u service-name --since "1 hour ago"
```

## Phase 4: Solution Implementation & Validation

### Fix Implementation Strategy

1. **Immediate Fixes (Hot Fixes)**:
   - Quick patches for critical issues
   - Rollback procedures ready
   - Minimal risk changes

2. **Systematic Fixes**:
   - Root cause resolution
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Documentation updates

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Monitoring and alerting improvements
   - Code quality enhancements
   - Process improvements

### Solution Validation Process
```bash
# Pre-deployment validation
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run build

# Deployment validation
kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f deployment.yaml
terraform plan

# Post-deployment validation
curl -f http://localhost:3000/health
npm run test:integration
```
