# Safe Refactoring

## Pre-Refactoring Analysis

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Uncommitted changes: !`git status --porcelain`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`
- Test status: !`npm test 2>/dev/null || pytest 2>/dev/null || echo "No test command detected"`

## Refactoring Target

Target: **$ARGUMENTS** (e.g., "utils.js to modern ES2024", "legacy API endpoints", "database schema")

## üîÑ Safe Refactoring Process

### 1. Pre-Refactoring Safety

- **Create backup branch**: Ensure clean rollback point
- **Run full test suite**: Establish baseline functionality
- **Analyze dependencies**: Map all affected code references
- **Document current behavior**: Capture existing functionality

### 2. Intelligent Code Analysis

- **Pattern detection**: Identify refactoring opportunities
- **Impact analysis**: Determine scope of changes
- **Breaking change assessment**: Evaluate compatibility risks
- **Performance implications**: Analyze performance impact

### 3. Safe Transformation Strategy

- **Incremental changes**: Small, testable refactoring steps
- **Atomic commits**: Each refactoring step as separate commit
- **Continuous testing**: Run tests after each change
- **Rollback readiness**: Immediate rollback if issues detected

## üõ†Ô∏è Refactoring Categories

### Code Modernization

- **Language features**: Upgrade to modern syntax and features
- **Framework updates**: Migrate to newer framework versions
- **API improvements**: Replace deprecated APIs
- **Performance optimization**: Implement efficient algorithms

### Architecture Improvements

- **Design patterns**: Apply better architectural patterns
- **Separation of concerns**: Improve code organization
- **Dependency injection**: Reduce coupling between components
- **Modularity**: Break down monolithic structures

### Technical Debt Reduction

- **Dead code removal**: Eliminate unused code and imports
- **Duplication elimination**: Consolidate repeated logic
- **Complex method simplification**: Break down large functions
- **Configuration improvements**: Externalize hardcoded values

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Pre-Refactoring Validation

- **Baseline tests**: Ensure all tests pass before starting
- **Coverage analysis**: Identify untested code paths
- **Integration testing**: Verify system-level functionality
- **Performance benchmarks**: Establish performance baselines

### During Refactoring

- **Unit test updates**: Modify tests for new implementations
- **Regression testing**: Continuous validation of existing functionality
- **Integration validation**: Ensure refactored components integrate properly
- **Performance monitoring**: Watch for performance regressions

### Post-Refactoring Verification

- **Full test suite**: Complete testing of refactored system
- **Manual testing**: Human verification of critical paths
- **Performance comparison**: Compare against pre-refactoring benchmarks
- **Documentation updates**: Update relevant documentation

## üö® Rollback Strategy

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

- **Test failures**: Any test regression triggers rollback consideration
- **Performance degradation**: Significant performance impact
- **Build failures**: Compilation or build errors
- **Integration issues**: System integration problems

### Manual Rollback Process

- **Staged rollback**: Roll back in reverse order of changes
- **Selective rollback**: Keep beneficial changes, revert problematic ones
- **Communication**: Notify team of rollback and reasons
- **Learning documentation**: Document lessons learned

## üîÑ Legacy Modernization & Multi-File Refactor (migrated from legacy prompts)

- Structured migration blueprint for outdated frameworks to modern architecture
- Automated batch rename and move operations spanning multiple directories
- API surface adaptation utilities with compatibility shims
- Progressive compilation & test checkpoints to ensure safety between refactor steps
- Rollback plan generation for each transformation phase
