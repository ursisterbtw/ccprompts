# Optimize Command

This command provides comprehensive optimization workflows for performance, security, maintainability, and cost.

## Usage

```
/optimize [target]
```

## Description

Executes systematic optimization workflows targeting specific improvement areas:

1. Current state analysis and baseline measurement
2. Bottleneck identification and impact assessment
3. Optimization strategy development and implementation
4. Performance validation and regression testing
5. Monitoring setup and continuous optimization
6. Documentation of improvements and lessons learned

## Parameters

- `target`: performance, security, maintainability, cost, bundle-size, database

## Examples

```
/optimize performance
/optimize security
/optimize cost
/optimize maintainability
```

## Workflow Steps

1. **Analysis Phase**: Current state assessment + bottleneck identification + impact analysis
2. **Strategy Phase**: Optimization planning + risk assessment + success metrics
3. **Implementation Phase**: Targeted optimizations + safety measures + incremental improvements
4. **Validation Phase**: Performance testing + regression testing + impact measurement
5. **Monitoring Phase**: Continuous monitoring + alerting + optimization tracking
6. **Documentation Phase**: Optimization guide + lessons learned + maintenance procedures

## Optimization Targets

- **Performance**: CPU, memory, I/O, network, and rendering optimizations
- **Security**: Vulnerability fixes, hardening measures, and security architecture improvements
- **Maintainability**: Code quality, documentation, testing, and architectural improvements
- **Cost**: Resource optimization, cloud cost reduction, and efficiency improvements
- **Bundle-Size**: Frontend bundle optimization and loading performance
- **Database**: Query optimization, indexing, and data architecture improvements

## Use Cases

- **Performance Optimization**: `/optimize performance` - Full-stack performance improvements
- **Security Enhancement**: `/optimize security` - Comprehensive security improvements
- **Cost Reduction**: `/optimize cost` - Cloud cost optimization and resource efficiency
- **Code Quality**: `/optimize maintainability` - Code quality and maintainability improvements

## Estimated Timeline

- **Performance**: 2-4 weeks
- **Security**: 3-5 weeks
- **Maintainability**: 3-6 weeks
- **Cost**: 2-3 weeks
