📊 Response Time Breakdown (Last 10 Commands)
Command                 │ Total Time │ Network │ Processing │ Tool Exec
───────────────────────┼────────────┼─────────┼────────────┼──────────
/read large-file.js    │    18.5s   │   2.1s  │    14.2s   │   2.2s
/edit complex-comp.tsx │    22.1s   │   1.8s  │    16.5s   │   3.8s

/analyze-project       │    31.4s   │   2.3s  │    24.1s   │   5.0s

🔥 Performance Bottlenecks
1. Large File Processing (avg 16.2s)
   - Files > 1000 lines taking excessive time
   - Recommendation: Use targeted reads with line ranges
   
2. Complex Analysis Operations (avg 24.1s)
   - Multi-file analysis overwhelming context
   - Recommendation: Break into smaller scoped operations
   
3. Tool Execution Delays (avg 3.8s)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Connection Problems

```text
Issue: MCP Server Connection Failed
===================================

Symptoms:
- Tools from specific MCP server not available
- Timeout errors when accessing server resources
- "Connection refused" or "Server not found" errors

Diagnostic Steps:
1. Check if MCP server process is running
   → ps aux | grep mcp-server
   
2. Verify port availability
   → netstat -tlnp | grep 3001
   
3. Test manual connection
   → curl http://localhost:3001/health
   
4. Check server logs
   → tail -f ~/.mcp/logs/github-server.log

Common Solutions:
- Restart MCP server: systemctl restart mcp-github
- Check configuration: ~/.mcp/config.json
- Update server: npm update -g @mcp/github-server
- Verify authentication: check API tokens

Prevention:
- Set up health monitoring for MCP servers
- Regular updates and maintenance schedule
- Automated restart on failure
```

### Performance Issues

```text
Issue: Slow Response Times
=========================

Symptoms:
- Commands taking longer than usual to complete
- Timeouts on complex operations
- High memory usage warnings

Diagnostic Steps:
1. Check system resources
   → top, htop, or Activity Monitor
   
2. Analyze network connectivity
   → ping api.anthropic.com
   → traceroute api.anthropic.com
   
3. Review session context usage
   → Check context window utilization
   
4. Identify resource-intensive operations
   → Review recent command history

Optimization Strategies:
- Break large operations into smaller chunks
- Use targeted file reads instead of full file access
- Clear session context when reaching limits
- Optimize MCP server performance
- Consider local caching strategies
```

### Tool Access Problems

```bash
Issue: Tool Permission Denied
============================

Symptoms:
- "Permission denied" errors when accessing files
- Tools not available or non-functional
- Limited functionality compared to expected

Resolution Steps:
1. Check file permissions
   → ls -la problematic-directory/
   
2. Verify user ownership
   → whoami
   → ls -la | grep username
   
3. Fix permissions if needed
   → Request admin assistance for ownership changes
   → Use proper permission management tools
   
4. Verify tool availability
   → which git, docker, npm, etc.
   
5. Check PATH environment
   → echo $PATH
   → Check if tool directories are included
```
