# Migrate

## Description

Intelligent migration system for databases, APIs, and infrastructure changes with automatic rollback capabilities and zero-downtime strategies.

## Usage

```bash
/migrate [type] [direction] [target]
```

## Parameters

- `type`: database, api, infrastructure, data (default: database)
- `direction`: up, down, status, validate (default: up)
- `target`: specific version or "latest" (default: latest)

## Examples

```bash
/migrate
/migrate database up latest
/migrate api down v2.0
/migrate infrastructure status
/migrate data validate
```

## Features

### Database Migrations

- Schema version control
- Data transformation scripts
- Multi-database support (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- Transaction safety with rollback

### API Migrations

- Endpoint versioning strategies
- Breaking change detection
- Client compatibility checking
- Gradual rollout support

### Infrastructure Migrations

- Blue-green deployments
- Canary releases
- Configuration migrations
- Service mesh updates

### Safety Mechanisms

- Pre-migration validation
- Backup before migration
- Health checks during migration
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Migration history tracking

<instructions>
1. Analyze and assess current state:
   - Evaluate existing migration infrastructure and processes
   - Identify migration requirements and constraints
   - Assess risks and dependencies for proposed changes
   - Review current backup and rollback capabilities

2. Implement comprehensive migration solutions:
   - Design safe migration strategies with validation checkpoints
   - Create automated backup and rollback procedures
   - Establish health monitoring and verification systems
   - Set up zero-downtime deployment workflows

3. Provide actionable recommendations:
   - Generate specific migration plans with risk assessment
   - Create prioritized implementation roadmaps with timelines
   - Provide rollback procedures and contingency planning
   - Establish success metrics and validation criteria

4. Facilitate migration excellence:
   - Create feedback loops and monitoring systems
   - Implement learning and adaptation mechanisms
   - Establish maintenance and evolution processes
   - Build team migration capability and knowledge sharing

5. Ensure safety and compliance:
   - Validate migration implementations against requirements
   - Ensure data integrity and system reliability
   - Create comprehensive migration documentation
   - Establish audit trails and accountability measures
