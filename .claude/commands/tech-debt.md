├── Minimum Debt Work: 20% per sprint (non-negotiable)
├── Maximum Debt Work: 50% per sprint (for critical issues)
├── Buffer Allocation: 10% for urgent debt that blocks features

Sprint 24 Example Integration:
├── Feature Work: 10.5 points (70%)
├── Technical Debt: 4.5 points (30%)
├── Debt Items Selected:
│   ├── Payment error handling (2 points) - blocks new payment features
│   ├── API documentation (1.5 points) - enables faster integration
│   └── Test coverage for auth (1 point) - prevents regression
├── Synergy Benefits:
│   ├── Payment work enables safer feature development
│   ├── Documentation reduces future support burden
│   └── Tests prevent bugs in upcoming auth changes

🎯 Debt Selection Criteria:
├── Directly enables upcoming features (weight: 40%)
├── Reduces immediate business risk (weight: 30%)
├── Improves team velocity (weight: 20%)
├── Learning opportunity for team (weight: 10%)

📋 Implementation Guidelines:
├── Pair debt work with junior developers for knowledge transfer
├── Document before/after metrics for each debt item
├── Include debt stories in sprint demo to show value
├── Celebrate debt reduction wins equally with feature delivery
