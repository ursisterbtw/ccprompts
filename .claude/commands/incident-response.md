### Investigation Framework
```
Root Cause Analysis Template
===========================

Incident Summary:
- ID: INC-2024-0115-001
- Severity: Critical
- Duration: 1h 15m
- Impact: 100% of users unable to access application

Timeline:
14:25 - First customer reports received
14:30 - Incident declared, war room activated
14:35 - Database connection issues identified
14:50 - Root cause determined: connection pool exhaustion
