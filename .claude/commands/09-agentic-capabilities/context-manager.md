<instructions>
You will implement advanced context management capabilities that maintain semantic understanding and relationships across development sessions.

## Phase 1: Context Analysis and Discovery

1. **Analyze Current Context**
   ```bash
   # Analyze conversation context
   - Review current conversation history and extract key entities
   - Identify semantic relationships and dependencies
   - Map context to project knowledge graph
   - Assess context completeness and gaps
   ```

2. **Semantic Entity Extraction**
   ```bash
   # Extract and categorize entities
   - Code entities (classes, functions, modules, APIs)
   - Business entities (features, requirements, stakeholders)
   - Technical entities (infrastructure, tools, configurations)
   - Relationship mapping between entities
   ```

3. **Context Scope Assessment**
   ```bash
   # Determine context boundaries
   - Session-specific context (current conversation)
   - Project-specific context (codebase knowledge)
   - Domain-specific context (technology stack, patterns)
   - Organizational context (team, processes, standards)
   ```

## Phase 2: Context Persistence and Storage

4. **Context Serialization**
   ```bash
   # Serialize context for persistence
   - Convert conversation context to structured format
   - Extract semantic embeddings for entities
   - Create relationship graphs and dependency maps
   - Generate context metadata and timestamps
   ```

5. **Knowledge Graph Construction**
   ```bash
   # Build and maintain knowledge graphs
   - Create nodes for entities and concepts
   - Establish edges for relationships and dependencies
   - Weight relationships based on relevance and recency
   - Implement graph traversal and query capabilities
   ```

6. **Context Storage Strategy**
   ```bash
   # Implement storage mechanisms
   - Local context files (.context/ directory)
   - Session-based context persistence
   - Project-wide context aggregation
   - Context versioning and history tracking
   ```

## Phase 3: Context Retrieval and Application

7. **Contextual Query Processing**
   ```bash
   # Process context-aware queries
   - Parse user queries for contextual intent
   - Retrieve relevant context from knowledge graph
   - Rank context by relevance and recency
   - Synthesize context for response generation
   ```

8. **Semantic Context Matching**
   ```bash
   # Match context semantically
   - Use semantic similarity for context retrieval
   - Implement fuzzy matching for entity resolution
   - Cross-reference related concepts and patterns
   - Provide context disambiguation when needed
   ```

9. **Context Integration**
   ```bash
   # Integrate context into responses
   - Inject relevant context into AI responses
   - Maintain context consistency across interactions
   - Update context based on new information
   - Resolve context conflicts and ambiguities
   ```

## Phase 4: Context Optimization and Maintenance

10. **Context Pruning and Cleanup**
    ```bash
    # Optimize context storage
    - Remove outdated or irrelevant context
    - Compress frequently accessed context
    - Archive historical context for long-term storage
    - Implement context garbage collection
    ```

11. **Context Quality Assessment**
    ```bash
    # Assess and improve context quality
    - Measure context relevance and accuracy
    - Identify context gaps and inconsistencies
    - Validate context against current project state
    - Generate context quality reports
    ```

12. **Context Visualization**
    ```bash
    # Visualize context relationships
    - Generate context relationship diagrams
    - Create interactive knowledge graph visualizations
    - Show context evolution over time
    - Provide context exploration interfaces
    ```

## Phase 5: Advanced Context Features

13. **Cross-Session Context Continuity**
    ```bash
    # Maintain context across sessions
    - Load relevant context at session start
    - Merge context from multiple sessions
    - Resolve context conflicts between sessions
    - Maintain context coherence over time
    ```

14. **Collaborative Context Sharing**
    ```bash
    # Enable team context sharing
    - Share context between team members
    - Merge individual contexts into team knowledge
    - Implement context access controls
    - Provide context collaboration features
    ```

15. **Context-Driven Automation**
    ```bash
    # Use context for automation
    - Trigger actions based on context changes
    - Provide context-aware suggestions
    - Automate routine tasks using context
    - Implement context-driven workflows
    ```

## Safety and Validation

16. **Context Validation**
    ```bash
    # Validate context integrity
    - Verify context consistency and accuracy
    - Check for context corruption or loss
    - Validate semantic relationships
    - Ensure context security and privacy
    ```

17. **Rollback and Recovery**
    ```bash
    # Implement context recovery
    - Create context backups and snapshots
    - Implement context rollback mechanisms
    - Recover from context corruption
    - Maintain context audit trails
    ```

## Educational Components

18. **Context Management Learning**
    ```bash
    # Teach context management concepts
    - Explain semantic understanding principles
    - Demonstrate knowledge graph construction
    - Show context optimization techniques
    - Provide context management best practices
    ```

19. **Interactive Context Exploration**
    ```bash
    # Enable context exploration
    - Provide context browsing interfaces
    - Allow context querying and filtering
    - Show context relationship exploration
    - Enable context annotation and tagging
    ```
