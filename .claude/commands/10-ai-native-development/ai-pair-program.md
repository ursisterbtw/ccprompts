        self.db = db_connection
        self.cache = cache_service
        self.logger = get_logger(__name__)  # AI knows logging pattern
    
    async def get_user(self, user_id: str) -> Optional[User]:
        # AI suggests caching pattern used elsewhere
        cache_key = f"user:{user_id}"
        cached_user = await self.cache.get(cache_key)
        if cached_user:
            return User.from_dict(cached_user)
        
        # AI suggests error handling pattern
        try:
            user_data = await self.db.fetch_user(user_id)
            if user_data:
                user = User.from_dict(user_data)
                await self.cache.set(cache_key, user.to_dict(), ttl=3600)
                return user
        except DatabaseError as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Database error fetching user {user_id}: {e}")

    mock_cache = Mock()
    service = UserService(mock_db, mock_cache)
    
    # Test cache hit scenario
    mock_cache.get.return_value = {"id": "123", "name": "John"}
    user = await service.get_user("123")
    
    assert user.id == "123"
    assert user.name == "John"
    mock_db.fetch_user.assert_not_called()  # AI knows caching should prevent DB call

# Then AI helps implement the actual method
