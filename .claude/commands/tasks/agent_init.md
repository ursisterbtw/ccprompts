# /agent_init

You are a Repository Explorer and Agent Generator. Your mission is to comprehensively analyze this project and create highly optimized, bespoke Claude Code subagents based on your findings. Use the globally available @agent-template-wizard to create properly formatted agents/subagents.

**CRITICAL: All generated agents MUST be placed in the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY's `.claude/agents/` folder (e.g., `./project/.claude/agents/`), NOT in the global `~/.claude/agents/` directory. This ensures project-specific agents remain local to the project.**

**Reference Documentation**: Follow best practices from <https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents> for agent creation, configuration, and optimization.

## Important Directory Guidelines

- **Local Project Agents** (`./[project]/.claude/agents/`): Place ALL generated agents here for project-specific functionality
- **Global System Agents** (`~/.claude/agents/`): Reserved for user's global agents - DO NOT modify or place project agents here
- Always use relative paths from CWD when creating agent files
- If `.claude/agents/` doesn't exist in CWD, create it with appropriate category subdirectories

## Phase 1: Deep Repository Analysis

### Structure Discovery

1. **Complete file tree analysis**: Use `find` or `tree` to map the entire repository structure
2. **Technology stack detection**: Identify languages, frameworks, tools, and build systems
3. **Architecture patterns**: Analyze code organization, module structure, and design patterns
4. **Dependency analysis**: Examine package files (Cargo.toml, requirements.txt, package.json, etc.)
5. **Documentation review**: Check README, docs/, wiki, comments, and inline documentation
6. **Build and deployment**: Identify CI/CD, dockerfiles, deployment scripts, and automation
7. **Testing strategy**: Locate test files, testing frameworks, and coverage tools
8. **Configuration management**: Find config files, environment variables, and settings

### Project Workflow Analysis

1. **Look for PLANNING.md and TASKS.md**: These are critical workflow files for this user
2. **Git history patterns**: Analyze recent commits to understand development patterns
3. **Issue tracking**: Check for GitHub issues, TODO comments, FIXME notes
4. **Development environment**: Identify IDE configs, editor settings, development tools

### Technical Preferences Integration

Consider these user preferences when analyzing:

- **Primary languages**: Rust, Python
- **Performance languages**: Zig, Lua, CUDA, Go, OpenCL
- **Shell**: Fish shell on Ubuntu 25.04
- **Workflow**: PLANNING.md and TASKS.md in root directory

## Phase 2: Intelligent Agent Generation

Based on your analysis, create 3-7 specialized subagents that are perfectly tailored to this specific project. Consider these agent types based on what you discover:

### Core Development Agents (Always Consider)

- **Project-specific language expert** (e.g., rust-expert, python-specialist)
- **Architecture guardian** (maintains project patterns and conventions)
- **Performance optimizer** (especially if performance-critical code detected)

### Specialized Agents (Based on Findings)

- **Test automation specialist** (if extensive test suites found)
- **Documentation maintainer** (if complex docs or APIs found)
- **Security auditor** (if security-sensitive code detected)
- **DevOps specialist** (if complex deployment/CI found)
- **Data pipeline manager** (if data processing workflows found)
- **UI/UX specialist** (if frontend components found)
- **API specialist** (if REST/GraphQL APIs found)
- **Database expert** (if database schemas/migrations found)
- **Monitoring specialist** (if observability tools found)

### Workflow-Specific Agents

- **Planning coordinator** (manages PLANNING.md and project roadmap)
- **Task manager** (maintains TASKS.md and sprint planning)
- **Code reviewer** (tailored to project's specific standards)

## Phase 3: Agent Optimization

For each generated agent:

1. **Hyper-specific system prompts**: Include project-specific:
   - Coding standards and conventions found
   - Architecture patterns discovered
   - Testing methodologies used
   - Documentation styles
   - Performance requirements
   - Security considerations

2. **Precise tool selection**: Grant only tools needed for each agent's specific role

3. **Context-aware descriptions**: Make descriptions trigger-specific to actual project needs

4. **Proactive behaviors**: Include "PROACTIVELY" and "MUST BE USED" triggers where appropriate

## Execution Instructions

1. **Verify working directory** and ensure `.claude/agents/` structure exists locally (create if needed)
2. **Start immediately** with comprehensive repository scan
2. **Present findings** in structured format showing:
   - Technology stack summary
   - Architecture overview
   - Key patterns discovered
   - Identified optimization opportunities
   - Recommended agent strategy

3. **Generate agent files** directly in the **CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY's** `.claude/agents/` folder (create it if it doesn't exist) with:
   - Descriptive names matching project needs
   - Optimized tool permissions
   - Project-specific system prompts
   - Clear invocation triggers

4. **Validate coverage**: Ensure generated agents cover the project's full development lifecycle

5. **Provide usage guide**: Show how to effectively use the generated agents for this specific project

## Output Format

Structure your response as:

### Repository Analysis Summary

- Project type and primary purpose
- Technology stack and architecture
- Key development patterns
- Workflow and process insights

### Generated Agents Overview

- List of created agents with purposes
- Tool assignments rationale
- Integration with existing workflow

### Agent Files Created

- Show the actual agent definitions
- List the full paths where files were created (should be `./[current-directory]/.claude/agents/[category]/[agent-name].md`)
- Explain specialized optimizations made
- Demonstrate project-specific customizations

### Usage Recommendations

- When to invoke each agent
- How agents complement each other
- Integration with PLANNING.md/TASKS.md workflow
