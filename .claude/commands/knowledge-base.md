- Clear navigation and cross-references
- Searchable tags and categories
- Version control and change tracking
- Regular review and update cycles

## Phase 3: Automated Content Extraction

### Code Documentation Extraction

```python
import ast
import re
from pathlib import Path

def extract_code_knowledge():
    """Extract knowledge from codebase"""
    knowledge = {
        'functions': [],
        'classes': [],
        'modules': [],
        'dependencies': [],
        'patterns': []
    }

    for file_path in Path('.').rglob('*.py'):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            try:
                tree = ast.parse(f.read())
                # Extract functions, classes, docstrings
                for node in ast.walk(tree):
                    if isinstance(node, ast.FunctionDef):
                        knowledge['functions'].append({
                            'name': node.name,
                            'file': str(file_path),
                            'docstring': ast.get_docstring(node),
                            'args': [arg.arg for arg in node.args.args]
                        })
            except SyntaxError:
                continue

    return knowledge
```

```python
def categorize_content(content):
    """Automatically categorize content by type and topic"""
    categories = {
        'getting-started': ['setup', 'install', 'quickstart', 'tutorial'],
        'architecture': ['design', 'pattern', 'structure', 'diagram'],
        'development': ['code', 'build', 'test', 'debug'],
        'operations': ['deploy', 'monitor', 'maintain', 'scale'],
        'troubleshooting': ['error', 'issue', 'problem', 'fix'],
        'best-practices': ['standard', 'guideline', 'convention', 'policy']
    }

    # NLP-based categorization logic
    content_lower = content.lower()
    scores = {}

    for category, keywords in categories.items():
        score = sum(1 for keyword in keywords if keyword in content_lower)
        scores[category] = score

    return max(scores, key=scores.get)
```

### Content Relationships

- Link related topics and concepts
- Create cross-references and see-also sections

- Establish content dependencies
- Map learning paths and progressions

### Metadata Management

```yaml
# Knowledge Base Metadata
title: "API Authentication Guide"
category: "development"
tags: ["api", "security", "authentication", "oauth"]
audience: ["developers", "security-team"]
difficulty: "intermediate"
last_updated: "2024-01-15"
reviewers: ["tech-lead", "security-lead"]
related_docs: ["security-guide.md", "api-reference.md"]
prerequisites: ["basic-api-knowledge"]
```

## Phase 5: Search and Discovery

### Full-Text Search Implementation

```javascript
// Search functionality
class KnowledgeBaseSearch {
    constructor(documents) {
        this.documents = documents;
        this.index = this.buildIndex();
    }

    buildIndex() {
        // Build inverted index for fast searching
        const index = {};
        this.documents.forEach((doc, docId) => {
            const words = doc.content.toLowerCase().split(/\W+/);
            words.forEach(word => {
                if (!index[word]) index[word] = [];
                index[word].push(docId);
            });
        });
        return index;
    }

    search(query) {
        const words = query.toLowerCase().split(/\W+/);
        const results = new Set();

        words.forEach(word => {
            if (this.index[word]) {
                this.index[word].forEach(docId => results.add(docId));
            }
        });

        return Array.from(results).map(id => this.documents[id]);
    }
}
```
