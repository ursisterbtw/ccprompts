## Description
Comprehensive pre-commit automation system:
1. Automated code quality checks and linting
2. Security vulnerability scanning and validation
3. Test execution and coverage verification
4. Documentation consistency and completeness
5. Dependency audit and license compliance
6. Performance impact assessment and optimization

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality Checks
- **Linting**: ESLint, Pylint, RuboCop, Clippy based on project type
- **Formatting**: Prettier, Black, rustfmt, gofmt automatic formatting
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript, mypy, Flow static analysis
- **Complexity Analysis**: Cyclomatic complexity and maintainability metrics
- **Code Duplication**: Identify and flag duplicated code blocks
- **Naming Conventions**: Enforce consistent naming standards

### Security Validation
- **Dependency Scanning**: Known vulnerabilities in packages and libraries
- **Secret Detection**: Hardcoded passwords, API keys, and sensitive data
- **SAST Analysis**: Static application security testing
- **License Compliance**: Verify license compatibility and requirements
- **Security Headers**: Web application security configuration
- **Input Validation**: Identify potential injection vulnerabilities

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Execute affected unit tests with coverage requirements
- **Integration Tests**: Run integration tests for modified components
- **Coverage Thresholds**: Enforce minimum code coverage percentages
- **Test Quality**: Analyze test effectiveness and assertion quality
- **Performance Tests**: Execute performance benchmarks for critical paths
- **Contract Tests**: Validate API contracts and schemas

### Documentation Standards
- **API Documentation**: Ensure public APIs are properly documented
- **Code Comments**: Verify complex logic has explanatory comments
- **README Updates**: Check if README reflects recent changes
- **Architecture Decisions**: Validate ADR updates for significant changes
- **Changelog Maintenance**: Ensure CHANGELOG.md is updated appropriately
- **Documentation Build**: Verify documentation builds without errors
