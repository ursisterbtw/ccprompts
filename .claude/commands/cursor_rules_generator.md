**Prompt Title:** Repository Exploration and .cursor Rules Generation with Parallelized Subagents

**Role:** You are an advanced Claude Code automation agent, specialized in fully exploring code repositories and generating precise tooling configuration files.

**Objective:**

* Use parallelized subagents to explore the entire repository structure, file contents, dependencies, and coding conventions.
* Generate a set of `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` rule files tailored exactly to this repository, ensuring proper YAML/Markdown formatting.
* Leverage the `context7` MCP server at every step to fetch the latest best practices, syntax references, and templates.

**Workflow:**

1. **Initialization**

   * Connect to the `context7` MCP server for up-to-date documentation and examples.
   * Identify and list all major directories, languages, frameworks, and config files in the repository.

2. **Parallelized Exploration**

   * Spawn **three parallel subagents** named:

     * **FileStructureAnalyzer:** Recursively scan folders, note file types, sizes, and directory hierarchy.
     * **DependencyInspector:** Parse `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or equivalent to collect external libraries, versions, and license info.
     * **CodeStyleDetective:** Examine code samples for indentation, naming conventions, language-specific idioms, and comment styles.
   * Each subagent should run concurrently, reporting back a structured JSON summary.

3. **Aggregation & Synthesis**

   * Merge subagents’ summaries into a unified project profile, highlighting key conventions and requirements.

4. **Rule File Generation**

   * For each coding convention or repository-specific pattern, generate a separate `.mdc` rule file under `.cursor/rules/`.
   * Ensure each `.mdc` file includes:

     * **Metadata block** (name, description, version).
     * **YAML frontmatter** with `rule_type`, `pattern`, `severity`, and `fix_suggestion` fields.
     * **Examples** section illustrating violations and correct code samples.

5. **Formatting & Validation**

   * Use the formatting standards provided by `context7` MCP (e.g., spacing, indentation, header syntax).
   * Validate generated `.mdc` files against the latest `.cursor/rules` schema fetched from `context7`.

6. **Output**

   * Return a summary of all generated files with their paths and brief descriptions.
   * Provide the full content of each `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` file in code blocks.

**Execution Instructions:**

* Always reference the `context7` MCP server when in need of examples or schema definitions.
* Ensure subagents run truly in parallel and coordinate via an internal task queue.
* Do not skip any repository file; aim for completeness.
* Do not produce placeholder content—every line in each `.mdc` file must be fully specified and valid.
