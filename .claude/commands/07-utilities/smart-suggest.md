### Advanced Context Detection

#### Technology Stack Profiling
```bash
# Automatic detection examples:
- Python + Django + PostgreSQL â†’ Web application
- React + Node.js + MongoDB â†’ Full-stack JavaScript
- Go + Docker + Kubernetes â†’ Microservices/Cloud-native
- Java + Spring + MySQL â†’ Enterprise application
```

#### Project Maturity Assessment
```bash
# Maturity indicators:

- Growth (6-18 months): Established patterns, scaling challenges
- Mature (18+ months): Stable architecture, optimization focus
- Legacy (3+ years): Modernization needs, technical debt
```

#### Risk Pattern Recognition
```bash
# Risk indicators:
- High complexity + Low test coverage = Quality risk
- Rapid growth + No monitoring = Operational risk  
- Multiple languages + Small team = Maintenance risk
- Compliance requirements + No security audit = Regulatory risk
```
