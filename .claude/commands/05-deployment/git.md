# Git Command

This command provides access to advanced Git workflow automation and repository management prompts.

## Usage

```
/git [operation] [complexity]
```

## Description

Implements sophisticated Git workflows and repository management:

- Advanced Git workflow automation with hooks
- Repository optimization and cleanup procedures
- Branch strategy implementation and management
- Commit message standardization and automation
- Git analytics and repository health monitoring

## Parameters

- `operation`: setup-flow, cleanup, migration, automation, analytics
- `complexity`: simple, advanced, enterprise

## Examples

```
/git setup-flow enterprise
/git cleanup advanced
/git migration simple
/git automation advanced
```

## Use Cases

- **Workflow Setup**: `/git setup-flow enterprise` - Complete Git Flow/GitHub Flow implementation
- **Repository Cleanup**: `/git cleanup advanced` - History cleanup, large file removal, optimization
- **Repository Migration**: `/git migration advanced` - VCS migration with history preservation
- **Git Automation**: `/git automation enterprise` - Hooks, automated workflows, and branch management
- **Repository Analytics**: `/git analytics advanced` - Commit analysis, code churn metrics, team insights


## üõ†Ô∏è Repository Migration & Advanced Automation (migrated from legacy Git workflow prompts)

- History rewrite strategies (filter-branch, git filter-repo) with safety snapshots
- Subtree and submodule migration patterns
- Large-file replacement and Git LFS enablement
- Automated hook scripts for conventional commit linting and signed commits
- Cross-platform Git tooling integrations (pre-commit, Husky, lint-staged)
