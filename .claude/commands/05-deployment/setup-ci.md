# CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Usage

```
/setup-ci [platform] [project-type]
```

Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipelines with security, testing, and deployment automation across multiple platforms.

## Examples

```bash
# GitHub Actions for Node.js
/setup-ci "github-actions" "nodejs"

# GitLab CI for Python project
/setup-ci "gitlab-ci" "python"

# Azure DevOps for .NET
/setup-ci "azure-devops" "dotnet"

# Jenkins pipeline for microservices
/setup-ci "jenkins" "microservices"

# Multi-environment deployment
/setup-ci "github-actions" "full-stack" "multi-env"
```

- **Container scanning**: Docker image security analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Platform-Specific Implementation

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18, 20]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run lint
```

### GitLab CI

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - security
  - deploy

variables:
  NODE_VERSION: "20"

cache:
  paths:
    - node_modules/

build:
  stage: build
  image: node:$NODE_VERSION
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/
```
