# WORKFLOW CONTINUATION PRIMER

## Purpose: Rehydrate state after context loss and resume the Explore→Plan→Code→Test→Report pipeline WITHOUT duplicating prior work.

================================================================
PHASE R0: STATE RECONSTRUCTION
1. Assert repo root (print absolute path).
2. Verify existence of root-level PLANNING.md and TASKS.md.
   - If either missing: STOP and emit: "FATAL: Missing required file(s). Re-run full workflow initializer."
3. Parse PLANNING.md:
   - Extract each canonical section (Title, Objective, Context / Constraints, Risks & Mitigations, Design Overview, Data / Types, Algorithm / Flow, Acceptance Criteria, Test Strategy Matrix, Performance Considerations, Security & Validation, Observability, Rollout / Migration, Documentation Updates, Open Questions, (optional) Execution Report).
   - Detect if any *mandatory* section is absent or empty (beyond explicit “Not Applicable: reason”).
     - If gaps → Create a “REPAIR PLAN” list.
4. Parse TASKS.md:
   - Build task index keyed by ID.
   - Count tasks per status: BACKLOG / IN_PROGRESS / BLOCKED / DONE.
   - Detect:
     - Duplicate IDs
     - Tasks with missing Depends IDs
     - Cycles in dependency graph
     - Tasks in DONE with unmet dependencies
   - If integrity issues → List them under “TASK LIST INTEGRITY ISSUES” and mark workflow status = “REPAIR_REQUIRED”.
5. Determine CURRENT_PHASE:
   Logic (in order):
     a. If planning sections incomplete OR open questions unresolved → CURRENT_PHASE=PLAN_FIX
     b. Else if there exist BACKLOG tasks not yet started → CURRENT_PHASE=CODE
     c. Else if tests absent or acceptance criteria not all verified → CURRENT_PHASE=TEST
     d. Else if Execution Report absent or incomplete → CURRENT_PHASE=REPORT
     e. Else CURRENT_PHASE=COMPLETE
6. Print a concise STATE SUMMARY block (YAML or fenced JSON) containing:
   - current_phase
   - counts {backlog,in_progress,blocked,done}
   - unresolved_open_questions (list or empty)
   - acceptance_criteria_status (each criterion: met|unmet|uncertain)
   - integrity_issues (if any)
   - next_actions (computed)

If CURRENT_PHASE=COMPLETE → STOP after emitting summary.

================================================================
PHASE R1: PLAN_FIX (iff current_phase=PLAN_FIX)
Goal: Repair missing / weak planning elements WITHOUT discarding valid content.
Actions:
 - Fill missing sections with concrete information (no placeholders).
 - Resolve Open Questions if answerable from codebase or obvious conventions; otherwise restate them crisply and STOP to request user input.
 - Update PLANNING.md in place (append under a “Plan Repair Log” subsection with timestamp).
On success: Recompute phase selection; if promoted → continue.

================================================================
PHASE R2: CODE (iff current_phase=CODE)
Goal: Continue implementing pending tasks.
Actions:
 - Select a batch of READY tasks (all dependencies DONE) from BACKLOG; move → IN_PROGRESS.
 - Implement minimal cohesive units; update files only per plan.
 - Update TASKS.md statuses immediately after each completed task (move → DONE with concise “Result:” note).
 - If a task blocked: move → BLOCKED with reason + prerequisite reference.
 - After batch: re-evaluate if BACKLOG depleted → transition to TEST.

Batch Size Heuristic:
 - Prefer 3–7 tasks per batch OR fewer if large (Est=L).

================================================================
PHASE R3: TEST (iff current_phase=TEST)
Goal: Validate full acceptance criteria.
Actions:
 - Generate/extend tests per Test Strategy Matrix (only for uncovered criteria).
 - Run tests; capture:
    - total, passed, failed
    - coverage (% if measurable)
    - performance notes (if defined)
 - For each unmet criterion: either fix code (loop back to CODE) or justify deferral (append to PLANNING.md “Deferred Criteria” section).
 - When all criteria met → transition to REPORT.

================================================================
PHASE R4: REPORT (iff current_phase=REPORT)
Goal: Produce / update Execution Report section in PLANNING.md (append if existing).
Include:
 - Final task status counts
 - Implementation summary (bullets)
 - Deviations from original plan + justification
 - Commands executed (exact)
 - Test results snapshot
 - Coverage/perf metrics
 - Residual risks / follow-up tasks (also append as new BACKLOG tasks if needed)
 - Timestamp (UTC)

After writing report:
 - Verify acceptance_criteria_status all “met”.
 - Output absolute paths to PLANNING.md, TASKS.md.
 - Emit “WORKFLOW_COMPLETE”.

================================================================
GUARDRAILS
- NEVER regenerate entire PLANNING.md or TASKS.md from scratch; only surgical updates.
- NO placeholder text (“TBD”, “???”, “lorem”).
- If required file malformed beyond safe incremental repair → STOP and request explicit user permission to reconstruct section(s).
- Maintain chronological append-only logs (“Plan Repair Log”, “Execution Report History”) at bottom of PLANNING.md.

================================================================
FAIL FAST
At any point if essential information is missing AND cannot be inferred, emit BLOCKING_QUESTIONS (numbered) and halt.

================================================================
RESUME TRIGGER
After printing STATE SUMMARY, immediately proceed to the phase handler unless:
 - BLOCKING_QUESTIONS non-empty
 - integrity_issues severe (e.g., dependency cycle)
In those cases: STOP and wait.

================================================================
START
Print “STATE_REHYDRATION_BEGIN” then execute Phase R0.
