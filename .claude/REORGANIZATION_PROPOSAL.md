# Repository Reorganization Proposal

## 🎯 Problem: Overwhelming Flat Structure

Currently, the repository has **38 commands in a flat directory structure**, which creates several problems:

- ❌ **Overwhelming for newcomers** - 38 choices with no guidance
- ❌ **No logical grouping** - Commands scattered without clear relationships  
- ❌ **Difficult discovery** - Hard to find relevant commands for specific tasks
- ❌ **No learning progression** - No clear path from beginner to advanced
- ❌ **Unprofessional appearance** - Looks like a tool dump rather than organized ecosystem

## 🚀 Solution: Intuitive Category Organization

Transform the flat structure into **8 logical categories** that mirror the development workflow:

```
