<instructions>
1. Baseline Performance Measurement:
   - Set up performance monitoring infrastructure
   - Establish current performance metrics
   - Identify user-facing performance KPIs
   - Create automated performance test suite

2. Profiling and Analysis:
   - CPU profiling to find hot paths
   - Memory profiling for allocation patterns
   - I/O profiling for disk and network
   - Database query analysis
   - Frontend rendering performance
   - Cache hit rate analysis

3. Backend Optimizations:
   - Optimize database queries (add indexes, rewrite queries)
   - Implement query result caching
   - Add application-level caching (Redis, Memcached)
   - Optimize API response payloads
   - Implement pagination and lazy loading
   - Use connection pooling
   - Optimize concurrent request handling
   - Implement request debouncing/throttling

4. Frontend Optimizations:
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Code splitting implementation
   - Lazy loading for routes and components
   - Image optimization and lazy loading
   - Minimize render cycles
   - Optimize state management
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Service worker for offline caching

5. Infrastructure Optimizations:
   - CDN configuration
   - Load balancer optimization
   - Auto-scaling policies
   - Database connection pooling
   - Container resource limits
   - Network topology optimization

6. Algorithm Optimization:
   - Replace O(nÂ²) with O(n log n) algorithms
   - Implement memoization for expensive computations
   - Use approximate algorithms where acceptable
   - Parallelize independent operations
   - Batch operations to reduce overhead

7. Create Performance Budget:
   - Define acceptable load times
   - Set bundle size limits
   - Establish API response time SLAs
   - Create alerting for performance regressions
