1. Knowledge Capture:
   - Interview domain experts (via code comments)
   - Document architectural decisions (ADRs)
   - Capture troubleshooting experiences
   - Record performance optimization learnings
   - Document security incident responses

2. Create Knowledge Structure:

   knowledge-base/
   ├── architecture/
   │   ├── decisions/
   │   ├── patterns/
   │   └── principles/
   ├── operations/
   │   ├── runbooks/
   │   ├── incident-responses/
   │   └── monitoring/
   ├── development/
   │   ├── setup-guides/
   │   ├── best-practices/
   │   └── code-examples/
   └── troubleshooting/
       ├── common-issues/
       ├── debugging-guides/
       └── performance/


3. Runbook Creation:
   - Service startup/shutdown procedures
   - Backup and restore processes
   - Disaster recovery plans
   - Performance tuning guides
   - Security incident responses
   - Database maintenance procedures

4. Decision Documentation:
   - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
   - Technology selection rationale
   - Design pattern choices
   - Trade-off analyses
   - Migration strategies

5. Make Knowledge Discoverable:
   - Implement full-text search
   - Create topic tags/categories
   - Build knowledge graph
   - Generate related articles
   - Create learning paths
