<instructions>
1. Knowledge Capture:
   - Interview domain experts (via code comments)
   - Document architectural decisions (ADRs)
   - Capture troubleshooting experiences
   - Record performance optimization learnings
   - Document security incident responses

2. Create Knowledge Structure:
   ```

   knowledge-base/
   ├── architecture/
   │   ├── decisions/
   │   ├── patterns/
   │   └── principles/
   ├── operations/
   │   ├── runbooks/
   │   ├── incident-responses/
   │   └── monitoring/
   ├── development/
   │   ├── setup-guides/
   │   ├── best-practices/
   │   └── code-examples/
   └── troubleshooting/
       ├── common-issues/
       ├── debugging-guides/
       └── performance/

   ```

3. Runbook Creation:
   - Service startup/shutdown procedures
   - Backup and restore processes
   - Disaster recovery plans
   - Performance tuning guides
   - Security incident responses
   - Database maintenance procedures

4. Decision Documentation:
   - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
   - Technology selection rationale
   - Design pattern choices
   - Trade-off analyses
   - Migration strategies

5. Make Knowledge Discoverable:
   - Implement full-text search
   - Create topic tags/categories
   - Build knowledge graph
   - Generate related articles
   - Create learning paths
</instructions>

<output_requirements>
1. Structured knowledge base with clear taxonomy
2. Searchable documentation with tagging system
3. Runbook templates for common operations
4. Decision record templates (ADRs)
5. Knowledge maintenance and update procedures
6. Learning path recommendations for team onboarding
