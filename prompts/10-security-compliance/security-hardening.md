<instructions>
Phase 1: Security Audit
1. Perform comprehensive security scan:
   - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
   - Dependency vulnerabilities
   - Container security
   - Infrastructure security
   - Access control audit
   - Data encryption status
   - Network security
   - API security

Phase 2: Application Security
2. Implement security headers:
```javascript
// security/headers.js
module.exports = {
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';",
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
  'Permissions-Policy': 'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()'
};
```

1. Input validation and sanitization:
   - Implement input validation schemas
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS prevention
   - Command injection prevention
   - Path traversal prevention
   - XXE prevention
   - SSRF prevention

2. Authentication hardening:
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Secure session management
   - Password policy enforcement
   - Account lockout mechanisms
   - Secure password reset
   - OAuth2/SAML implementation

3. Authorization implementation:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
   - Principle of least privilege
   - API key management
   - JWT security
   - Permission inheritance

Phase 3: Data Security
6. Encryption implementation:

- Data at rest encryption
- Data in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Database field encryption
- File storage encryption
- Key management (KMS)
- Certificate management

7. Data privacy compliance:
   - PII identification and mapping
   - Data retention policies
   - Right to erasure implementation
   - Data portability features
   - Consent management
   - Audit logging

Phase 4: Infrastructure Security
8. Network security:

- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS protection
- Rate limiting
- IP whitelisting
- VPN configuration
- Network segmentation

9. Container security:
   - Base image hardening
   - Non-root containers
   - Read-only filesystems
   - Security scanning
   - Runtime protection
   - Secret management

Phase 5: Monitoring and Response
10. Security monitoring:
    - Intrusion detection
    - Anomaly detection
    - Security event logging
    - Failed login monitoring
    - File integrity monitoring
    - Vulnerability scanning

11. Incident response:
    - Incident response plan
    - Security playbooks
    - Forensics procedures
    - Communication protocols
    - Recovery procedures
