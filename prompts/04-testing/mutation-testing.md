Phase 1: Test Suite Assessment
1. Analyze existing test suite:
   - Test coverage metrics
   - Test quality indicators
   - Execution time analysis
   - Flaky test identification
   - Code coverage gaps

2. Mutation testing framework setup:
   - Configure mutation testing tools
   - Define mutation operators
   - Set up test execution environment
   - Configure reporting systems
   - Define quality thresholds

Phase 2: Mutation Test Implementation
3. Implement mutation operators:
   - Arithmetic operator mutations
   - Relational operator mutations
   - Logical operator mutations
   - Statement deletion mutations
   - Boundary value mutations

4. Execute mutation testing:
   - Generate mutant code versions
   - Run test suite against mutants
   - Analyze mutation survival rates
   - Identify weak test areas
   - Generate improvement recommendations

Phase 3: Test Enhancement
5. Improve test coverage:
   - Add tests for surviving mutants
   - Enhance assertion quality
   - Improve edge case coverage
   - Add negative test scenarios
   - Implement property-based testing

6. Continuous mutation testing:
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
   - Automate mutation score tracking
   - Set up quality gates
   - Monitor test quality trends
   - Generate progress reports

Security Considerations:
- Ensure mutation testing doesn't expose sensitive data in logs
- Validate that mutated code doesn't create security vulnerabilities
- Implement secure test data management and isolation
- Monitor for potential information leakage during testing
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations during testing
</instructions>

<mutation_operators>
Define comprehensive mutation operators:

1. **Arithmetic Mutations**
   - Replace + with -, *, /, %
   - Increment/decrement by 1
   - Negate numeric values

2. **Conditional Mutations**
   - Replace && with ||
   - Negate boolean conditions
   - Replace comparison operators

3. **Statement Mutations**
   - Delete statements
   - Replace return values
   - Modify loop conditions
</mutation_operators>

<output_requirements>
1. Complete mutation testing framework implementation
2. Comprehensive mutation score analysis with improvement recommendations
3. Enhanced test suite with improved mutation kill rate
4. CI/CD integration for continuous mutation testing
5. Quality metrics dashboard for ongoing test effectiveness monitoring
