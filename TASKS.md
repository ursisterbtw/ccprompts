## Risk Mitigation Tasks

### High-Risk Items
- **T11, T15, T16, T19, T20, T24** (Est=L) - Large tasks requiring careful breakdown
- **T32** (Enterprise compliance) - Complex regulatory requirements
- **T28** (Multi-repo) - Complex coordination challenges

### Mitigation Strategies
- Break large tasks into smaller subtasks during implementation
- Create proof-of-concept implementations for complex features
- Establish testing frameworks early for validation
- Regular checkpoint reviews at phase boundaries
