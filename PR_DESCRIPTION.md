   - Files: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, `.github/workflows/test-cicd.yml`

2. **Enhanced Secret Detection**
   - Improved validation script with placeholder filtering
   - Better pattern matching for actual vs. example credentials
   - File: `scripts/validate-prompts.js`

### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
3. **Eliminated Workflow Duplication (75% reduction)**
   - Created reusable composite action for Node.js setup
   - Standardized dependency installation across workflows
   - New file: `.github/actions/setup-node-env/action.yml`

4. **Simplified PR Template (75% reduction)**
   - Streamlined from 400+ lines to 100 lines
   - Maintained essential CI/CD quality gates
   - File: `.github/pull_request_template.md`

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
5. **Fixed Redundant Caching Issues**
   - Unified caching strategy in composite action
   - Eliminated conflicting cache mechanisms

6. **Improved Error Handling**
