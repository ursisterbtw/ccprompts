# PLANNING.md - ccprompts Modern Agentic Expansion

## Title
Expand ccprompts from 40 to 70 commands with modern agentic capabilities, MCP integration, and enterprise-scale features

## Objective
Transform ccprompts into a comprehensive 70-command ecosystem that leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP), multi-agent orchestration, AI-native development patterns, and enterprise governance capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility and security-first design principles.

## Context / Constraints

### Current State
- **40 production-ready commands** across 8 phases (00-08)
- Established XML-structured command format with role, activation, instructions, and output sections
- Safety-first approach with containerized execution via Dagger
- Team collaboration focus with educational components
- Compliance support for SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing command structure and XML format
- All new commands must include safety validation and rollback procedures
- Educational components required in every command
- Security-first design with audit trails
- Node.js >=18.0.0 environment
- Existing toolchain: npm, Jest, markdownlint, Dagger

### Business Constraints
- Backward compatibility with existing 40 commands
- Production-ready quality standards
- Team-oriented design for collaboration
- Compliance automation requirements
- Open source MIT license

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| MCP server compatibility issues | High | Medium | Extensive testing matrix, fallback mechanisms |
| Command complexity overwhelming users | Medium | High | Progressive disclosure, discovery commands |
| Security vulnerabilities in new features | High | Low | Security-first design, audit trails, validation |
| Performance degradation with 70 commands | Medium | Medium | Lazy loading, command categorization |
| Breaking changes to existing workflows | High | Low | Comprehensive backward compatibility testing |

## Design Overview

### New Architecture: 70 Commands Across 11 Phases

**Phase 09: Advanced Agentic Capabilities (12 commands)**
- MCP server integration and discovery
- Multi-agent orchestration and coordination
- Context management and semantic understanding
- Agent specialization and workflow automation

**Phase 10: AI-Native Development (10 commands)**
- Advanced AI pair programming
- Semantic code understanding and generation
- Predictive development and optimization
- AI-assisted debugging and testing

**Phase 11: Enterprise & Scale (8 commands)**
- Multi-repository coordination
- Enterprise governance and compliance
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Organizational knowledge management

### Integration Strategy
- **MCP Protocol**: Leverage 1000+ available MCP servers for extended capabilities
- **Multi-Agent**: Implement sophisticated agent coordination patterns
- **Context Awareness**: Deep semantic understanding across all operations
- **Enterprise Ready**: Scale from individual to organizational governance

## Data / Types

### Command Structure (Maintained)
```xml
<role>
System: You are an expert [domain] specialist...
</role>

<activation>
User requests: /command-name [parameters]
</activation>

<instructions>
[Structured implementation steps]
</instructions>

<output_format>
[Expected output structure]
</output_format>
```

### New Configuration Schema
```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "total_commands": 70,
  "phases": {
    "09-agentic-capabilities": 12,
    "10-ai-native-development": 10,
    "11-enterprise-scale": 8
  },
  "features": {
    "mcp_integration": true,
    "multi_agent": true,
    "enterprise_governance": true
  }
}
```

## Algorithm / Flow

### Implementation Sequence
1. **Planning Phase** - Create PLANNING.md and TASKS.md
2. **Directory Structure** - Create new phase directories (09-11)
3. **Command Implementation** - Systematic creation of all 30 new commands
4. **Integration Testing** - Validate command interactions and workflows
5. **Documentation Updates** - Update README.md and CLAUDE.md
6. **Quality Assurance** - Lint, validate, and test all components

### Command Creation Pattern
```bash
# For each new command:
1. Create .md file with XML structure
2. Include safety validation steps
3. Add educational components
4. Implement rollback procedures
5. Add to command discovery system
```

## Acceptance Criteria
