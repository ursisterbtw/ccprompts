    { pattern: /api[_-]?key\s*=\s*["'][^"']{16,}["']/gi, message: 'Hardcoded API key detected' },
    // ... comprehensive pattern matching with placeholder detection
  ];
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment Strategies

### 1. **Environment Progression**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Development] --> B[Staging]
    B --> C[Production]
    
    A --> D[Feature Branches]
    D --> B
    
    C --> E[Rollback Available]
    E --> B
```

#### **Staging Environment**
