## ðŸ”¬ Research-Based Techniques

### 1. Thread-of-Thought (47.2% improvement)
Best for chaotic debugging scenarios:
```python
# Maintains multiple reasoning paths
# Handles conflicting information
# Aggregates with confidence weights
```

### 2. TextGrad (20% improvement)
Iterative optimization using feedback:
```python
# Uses feedback as 'gradients'
# Structured improvement cycles
# Clear evaluation criteria
```

### 3. Meta-Prompting (25% improvement)
Template-based optimization:
```python
# Structure-focused design
# Placeholder flexibility
# Token-efficient patterns
```

### 4. SCULPT (15% improvement)
Hierarchical task breakdown:
```python
# Multi-level structure
# Two-phase feedback loops
# Systematic coverage
```

### 5. OPRO (8% improvement)
LLM-as-optimizer approach:
```python
# Iterative prompt improvement
# Performance history tracking
# Best-of-N selection
```

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Guide

### Quick Start (No API Key Required)
```bash
# Run the demo to see techniques in action
python demo_prompt_optimization.py

# View comprehensive results
python show_optimization_results.py
```

### Full Implementation (Requires API Key)
```bash
# Set your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

```

### Integration Example
```python
from anthropic_prompt_optimizer import AnthropicPromptOptimizer
from prompt_scorer import PromptScorer

# Initialize
optimizer = AnthropicPromptOptimizer()
scorer = PromptScorer()

# Optimize a prompt
request = PromptOptimizationRequest(
    task_description="Review Python code for security vulnerabilities",
    optimization_goal="accuracy",
    context={'language': 'Python', 'focus': 'security'}
)

# Get optimized prompt
result = await optimizer.optimize_prompt(request, strategy='TextGrad')
print(f"Improvement: {result.expected_improvement*100}%")
```
